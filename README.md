#Parking Tracker
A proof-of-concept NativeScript + WatchKit app that uses Express/MongoDB to keep tabs on available parking time

Users can set the parking time and can ask the database when it's time to leave. Once the NativeScript team adds Notification support, the watch can tell the user when he or she has to repark. This makes for a nice extension to the Spotter application, which shows you the unoccupied parking spots near your location or a specified
address. A potential extension would be adding GPS coordinates of the parking spot to the database, and when it's time to move, have the application recommend the closest unoccupied spot that you can move to.
